# quick-merge

A distributable, adaptable, stable, in-memory comparison-sort sorting algorithm with worst case O(n\*log(n)) and best case O(n) in the sorted and reversed case.  Average case number of comparisons approaches n\*log_2(n) while the sorted and reversed cases are about 4\*n comparisons.


Swapping time will be reduced in the future by using skip lists (with indexical access) to store data arrays.
